# üöÄ Ansible Overview

Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task.

---

## ‚úÖ Common Use Cases

1. Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows  
2. Manage and maintain system configuration  
3. Continuously deploy complex software  
4. Perform zero-downtime rolling updates  

---

## üìú How It Works

Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called **playbooks** to automate tasks.  
You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook, and Ansible ensures the system remains in that state.

---

## üß† Core Principles of Ansible

### 1. Agent-less Architecture
- No need to install additional software across your infrastructure.
- Uses SSH for communication.

### 2. Simplicity
- Playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax.
- Code reads like documentation.
- Decentralized access using existing OS credentials.

### 3. Scalability and Flexibility
- Modular design supports:
  - Multiple operating systems
  - Cloud platforms
  - Network devices

### 4. Idempotence and Predictability
- Ensures consistent system state.
- Re-running playbooks doesn‚Äôt cause unintended changes.

## üîë Key Concepts

- **Inventory**: Lists target hosts (static or dynamic).
- **Playbooks**: YAML files defining tasks and configurations.
- **Tasks**: Individual actions executed on hosts.
- **Modules**: Built-in tools for system operations (e.g., file, package, service).
- **Roles**: Structured, reusable playbook components (tasks, vars, handlers).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation of Ansible

### Install via APT
```bash
# Ansible Installation & Configurations

## For Debian/Ubuntu : let's update the system first by using below commands:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade -y

  sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
  sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
  sudo apt install ansible -y


## On RHEL/CentOS : let's update the system first by using below commands:

  sudo yum update -y
  
  Install Ansible
  On RHEL/CentOS, you can install Ansible by enabling the EPEL repository:

  sudo yum install epel-release -y
  sudo yum install ansible -y


## Now let's Verify Installation

  ansible --version


## You should see output similar to

  ansible [core 2.14.3]
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/user/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.10 (default, May  3 2021, 08:55:58) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110]

## Configure Inventory

sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
ansible-inventory --list -y

[servers]
server1 ansible_host=<Public IP>
server2 ansible_host=<Public IP>
server3 ansible_host=<Public IP>

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/<file>


## ‚ö° Ad-Hoc Commands vs Modules

Ad-Hoc Commands
ansible all -a "df -h" -u ubuntu
ansible servers -a "uptime" -u ubuntu

Modules
ansible all -m ping -u ubuntu
