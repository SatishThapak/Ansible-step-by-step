## ✅ Common Use Cases

1. Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows  
2. Manage and maintain system configuration  
3. Continuously deploy complex software  
4. Perform zero-downtime rolling updates

## 📜 How It Works

Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called **playbooks** to automate tasks.  
You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook, and Ansible ensures the system remains in that state.

## 🧠 Core Principles of Ansible

### 1. Agent-less Architecture
- No need to install additional software across your infrastructure.
- Uses SSH for communication.

### 2. Simplicity
- Playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax.
- Code reads like documentation.
- Decentralized access using existing OS credentials.

### 3. Scalability and Flexibility
- Modular design supports:
  - Multiple operating systems
  - Cloud platforms
  - Network devices

### 4. Idempotence and Predictability
- Ensures consistent system state.
- Re-running playbooks doesn’t cause unintended changes.
