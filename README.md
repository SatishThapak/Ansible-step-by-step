# 🛠️ Introduction to Ansible
Ansible is an open-source, agentless automation tool for:

Configuration management

Application deployment

Orchestration

It uses SSH for communication and follows a declarative approach—you define the desired state, not the steps to get there.


# 🔑 Key Concepts
$Inventory$: Lists target hosts (static or dynamic).

$Playbooks$: YAML files defining tasks and configurations.

$Tasks$: Individual actions executed on hosts.

$Modules$: Built-in tools for system operations (e.g., file, package, service).

$Roles$: Structured, reusable playbook components (tasks, vars, handlers).
